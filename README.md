**Overview:**
Create a web application that allows users to share, discover, and rate recipes. Users can register, log in, and upload their favorite recipes to the platform. Other users can browse and search for recipes, give ratings, and leave comments. The application will have user authentication, a database to store recipes and user data, and a user-friendly interface for seamless recipe sharing.

**Key Features:**

1. User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality using email and password or social media accounts (Google, Facebook, etc.).
2. Recipe Upload and Management: Allow registered users to upload new recipes. Each recipe should have a title, ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, and an image.
3. Recipe Search and Filter: Provide a search bar to let users search for recipes by title or ingredients. Implement filtering options to sort recipes by cuisine, dietary preferences, or cooking difficulty.
4. Recipe Rating and Comments: Allow users to rate recipes and leave comments. Display average ratings and the number of ratings for each recipe.
5. User Profile: Create user profiles where users can view and manage their uploaded recipes, as well as see their average recipe ratings.
6. Favorite Recipes: Implement a feature for users to mark recipes as favorites and create a separate section to view their favorite recipes.
7. Trending Recipes: Display a section on the platform for trending recipes based on the highest ratings or recent uploads.

**Tech Stack:**
Backend: Use a backend framework like Node.js with Express to handle the server-side logic and API endpoints. For the database, you can use PostgreSQL or MySQL to store recipes, user information, ratings, and comments.

Frontend: Use a frontend framework like React.js to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling.

Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.

**Additional Considerations:**

1. Image Handling: Allow users to upload recipe images and implement image resizing to optimize storage and display.
2. Data Validation: Validate user input on both the frontend and backend to ensure the quality of uploaded recipes and comments.
3. Pagination: Implement pagination for recipe browsing to enhance user experience, especially when there are many recipes.
4. Performance: Optimize database queries and API endpoints for better application performance.

**1. Social Sharing:** Allow users to share their favorite recipes on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or via email. This will help increase the platform's visibility and attract more users.

**2. User Followers/Following:** Implement a feature where users can follow other users whose recipes they like. The users' home feed can then display recipes from the people they follow, creating a sense of community within the platform.

**3. Recipe Reviews:** Allow users to write detailed reviews for recipes they've tried. This can include the modifications they made, cooking tips, or any other feedback. Reviews can help other users decide which recipes to try and can also encourage engagement among users.

**4. Recipe Tags and Categories:** Enable users to add tags and select categories for their recipes. This will help users easily find recipes related to specific cuisines, dietary preferences, or special occasions.

**5. Weekly Meal Planner:** Implement a feature that allows users to plan their meals for the week. Users can add recipes to their meal planner and generate a shopping list based on the ingredients needed.

**6. Recipe Bookmarking:** Allow users to bookmark recipes they want to try later. This feature will help users easily access and keep track of recipes they find interesting.

**7. Recipe Video Integration:** Provide an option for users to add video links (e.g., YouTube) to their recipe posts. Videos can be beneficial for demonstrating complex cooking techniques and engaging users visually.

**8. User Activity Feed:** Create a user activity feed that shows recent recipe uploads, ratings, and comments from the users they follow. This will keep users updated on the latest happenings within the community.

**9. Advanced Search Filters:** Enhance the recipe search functionality by adding advanced filters such as cooking time, serving size, calories, or specific dietary requirements (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).

**10. Multi-Language Support:** If possible, offer support for multiple languages to make the platform accessible to a broader audience.

**11. Email Notifications:** Set up email notifications to inform users about new recipe uploads, comments, or activity related to their profile.

**12. Reporting and Moderation:** Implement a reporting system to allow users to report inappropriate or offensive content. Also, consider moderation features to review and approve recipes before they are publicly visible.

**13. Recipe Ratings and Statistics:** Provide users with insights into their recipe performance, such as average ratings, the number of views, and the number of favorites. This can motivate users to improve their cooking and sharing skills.

**14. Admin Dashboard:** Create an admin dashboard to manage user accounts, reported content, and site analytics.
